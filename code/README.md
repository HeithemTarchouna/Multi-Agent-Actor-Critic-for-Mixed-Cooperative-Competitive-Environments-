# Multi-Agent-Deep-Deterministic-Policy-Gradients
A Pytorch implementation of the multi agent deep deterministic policy gradients(MADDPG) algorithm

We would like to give credits to :
- Phil Tabor for his tutorials on maddpg and ddpg, his implementation surved as a good basis and was later modified,expanded upon to match the paper more closely and add ensemble policy implementation.

- AgileRL team who were very helpful in answering some questions we had about the maddpg algorithm and their results on the coaperative communication environment from pettingzoo.
